This is me practicing interview questions. To get better.
1. Find the median of two sorted arrays.
    tips:
    find the length of the two arrays indidviually, merge them into one by using the bubble sort method
    check for the length of the array, get the middle which is the lenght //2 and return it as the median.
    Where the array is even number, that is len % 2 == 0, then you need the middle number and the left most number, which is middle -1, and get the average. This is the logic. Now, unto the next question.
